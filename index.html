      <p class="home-text-1">
      Mice are social, intelligent, and curious creatures with lots of personality. 
      Unlike wild mice, fancy mice are domesticated and bred to be docile in nature. 
      They are inexpensive pets which don't require much supervision or attention as they are natural survivors.

      <h2 class="home-header-2">They make great pets</h2>
      <p class="home-text-2">
        Mice love to explore and play. 
        While they can be skittish at first, they will quickly bond with you and be comfortable around your presence.
        Familiar mice will even approach you just to say hello.
        Once they get to know you well enough, they will happily accept being held or pet.
        They can even be trained to peform fascinating feats!

      <h2 class="home-header-3">They take care of themselves</h2>
      <p class="home-text-3">
        Mice want nothing more than to have a safe, dark corner they can call home. 
        They are excellent home-keepers who know how to keep tidy and cozy.
        If you give them a box or small shelter, they will quickly make it their own by insulating the interior and chewing new entryways.
        All that you need to provide them with is clean water, appropriate food, and fresh bedding;
        All of which are relatively cheap and easy to acquire.
