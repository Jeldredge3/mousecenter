      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>If you have a pet mouse, do you ever have trouble finding out what foods they can safely eat and what foods to avoid? 
        There are several resources out there to educate fancy mice owners, however, many of those resources only provide bits and pieces of information,
        making readers having to jump from one website to another. As a pet mice owner myself,
        I decided to create a website to provide as much context as possible to help new owners learn how to be successful caretakers for their pet mice.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience this website is directed towards are individuals and parents ages 18-40 who are thinking of adopting a pet mouse or
      who are already taking care of pet mice. They would likely not know much about taking care of mice, which is why they would be visiting the site  to research. 
      Fancy mice are generally cheap pets that don't require a lot of attention, so visitors of the website
      would likely be making anywhere from 17,000-60,000 a year.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Baloo Da 2  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I went with "Baloo Da 2" for my heading font as it had a neat roundness to it, which seemed match the logo I made pretty well.
        The font is easy to read and has a relaxing tone. I think it will do well to engage readers and keep them reading until they find out the answers to their questions.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Roboto Slab  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        San-serif fonts blend in too much with the header, so I chose "Roboto Slab" to provide contrast.
        The slab-serif style has a very square and sharp appearance, which is makes the text stand out. 
        It is a fun combination to have round and flat fonts work together.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.

        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        Mice are social, intelligent, and curious creatures with lots of personality. 
        Unlike wild mice, fancy mice are domesticated and bred to be docile in nature. 
        They are inexpensive pets which don't require much supervision or attention as they are natural survivors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike hamsters who are constantly looking for a way to escape and explore, mice like to settle in a dark space and stay close to home.
        While they can be skittish at first, they will quickly bond with you and become comfortable and playful around your presence.
        Given enough effort, they can even be trained to peform fascinating feats.  
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking into adopting a pet mouse, or have questions regarding how to best care for your mice, 
        we'll provide you with the information you need to be a successful caretaker.

      <h3>Care</h3>
      <p>
        In the wild, mice live together in large groups. They don't do well alone. Fancy mice are not very different. 
        While taking care of pet mice, it's important for them to have company. 
        Female mice can be kept in groups and will keep eachother company, given that there is an appropriate amount of space for them to co-exist. 
        Male mice on the other hand are best kept apart from other mice as they tend to fight potential rivals. 
        If you are taking care of a single mouse, be sure to give it plenty of attention, and it will do just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        While taking care of your mice, it's important to provide it with space to explore and keep them stimulated with activities to do.
        They love to run, so a mouse-wheel is perfect for them. Avoid smaller wheels that make them arch or awkwardly twist their back.
        To keep them active, change up their scenery and reposition the objects in the cage. This will make it seem like a whole area to them.
        It's also a good idea to introduce new objects into their enviroment every once in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        For mice to be healthy, it's important for your mice to have access to water, as they can't survive long without proper hydration.
        They also need to have something to gnaw on. Gnawing allows mice to keep their teeth strong and trimmed, while also providing them with something to do.
        They love to chew cardboard and wood. Store-bought wood is your best option as branches from outside may contain pesticides or harmful bugs.
        They can also safely chew popsicle stick crafts held together with hot-glue. 
        Avoid objects with painted surfaces as they can be harmful to your mice. 
        As a general rule for mice, simple is best.

      <h3>Nutrition</h3>
      <p>
        Mice are omnivores and can eat almost anything a human can. Like humans, they need a balanced and low calorie diet to keep healthy. 
        Most Rat & Mouse pellet food brands you can get at your local pet store will be the best source of food for them, as they often contain a variety of grains and vitamins.
        Not all pellet food you find is safe for mice, however. Some package mixes contain food that is harmful and even poisonous even though a mouse might be featured on the packaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acidic or fatty foods should not be fed to your mice. Some examples include: Oranges, lemons, grapefruit, grapes, raisins, lettuce, avacado, onions, garlic, walnuts, peanuts, apple-seeds, coffee, raw beans,
        raw meats, bacon, chocolate, as well as salty or spicy foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you know what to avoid, there are plenty of nutrional options that are great for mice. 
        Healthy foods include vegitables like brocoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, cellery, cucumber, and peas.
        Fruits such as apples, apricots, blueberries, berries, dried bananas, mangos, melons, peaches, pears, plums, and coconut.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many other foods that they enjoy, however, some should be reserved for special treats given in small portions once every few days or once a week. 
        Too much fatty foods can lead to obesity and malnourishment in your mice.
        Safe treat foods include: Cereals (Cornflakes, Special K, Bran Flakes, Rice Krispies, Oats), biscuts, breads, boiled eggs, cooked-dried pastas and rice, cheese, dog biscuts, fresh mealworms, and sunflower seeds. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When feeding your mice wet foods, such as a fresh banana or strawberry, be sure to not keep it in the cage too long, as they can quickly spoil and give your mice upset stomach.
