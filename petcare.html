      <h1 class="petcare-header-1">How to care for fancy mice</h1>
      <p class="petcare-text-1">
        In the wild, mice live together in large groups. 
        They don't do well alone. Fancy mice are not very different. While taking care of pet mice, it's important for them to have company. 
        Female mice can be kept in groups and will keep eachother company, given that there is an appropriate amount of space for them to co-exist. 
        Male mice on the other hand are best kept apart from eachother as they tend to fight potential rivals. 
        If you are taking care of a single mouse, be sure to give it plenty of attention and it will do just fine.

      <h2 class="petcare-header-2">Provide them with things to do</h2>
      <p class="petcare-text-2">
        While taking care of your mice, it's important to provide it with space to explore and keep them stimulated with activities to do. 
        They love to run, so a mouse-wheel is perfect for them. Avoid smaller wheels that make them arch or awkwardly twist their back. 
        To keep them active, change up their scenery and reposition the objects in the cage. This will make it seem like a whole area to them. 
        It's also a good idea to introduce new objects into their enviroment every once in a while.

      <h2 class="petcare-header-3">Simple is best</h2>
      <p class="petcare-text-3">
        For your mice to be healthy, it's important that they have access to clean water as they can't survive long without proper hydration. 
        They also need to have good materials to gnaw on. Gnawing allows mice to keep their teeth strong and trimmed, while also providing them with something to do. 
        Mice love to chew cardboard and wood. Store-bought wood is your best option as branches from outside may contain pesticides or harmful bugs. 
        They can also safely chew popsicle stick crafts that are held together with hot-glue. 
        Avoid objects with painted surfaces as they can be harmful to your mice. 
        As a general rule for mice, simple is best.

      <h2 class="petcare-header-4">Promote a healthy enviroment</h2>
      <p class="petcare-text-4">
        Mice like to keep themselves clean and will often pick a single location to be their designated bathroom.
        However, they have a habbit of making their surrounding enviroment dirty.
        It's a good practice to exchange their old bedding material for fresh bedding every 1-2 weeks.
        You'll know it's time when their cage begins to stink.
        Also keep an eye out for other objects in their habitat that may need cleaning, such as their waterspout, food bowl, and running wheel.
